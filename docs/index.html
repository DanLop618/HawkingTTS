                it is not just a simple bot. It has tons of features and customizations that will make it fit the needs of each server without losing the fun.</p>

                <h2 id="modules">Modules:</h2>

                <p><b>Hawking's</b> works based on modules. These modules determine the behavior of the bot within the servers.<br>
                These modules are:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Text to Speech</li>
                    <li>Voice Utilities</li>
                    <li>Temporary Voice Channels <code>&nbsp(under&nbspdevelopment)&nbsp</code></li>
                    <li>Speech to Text <code>&nbsp(under&nbspdevelopment)&nbsp</code></li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <h2 id="mainfeatures">Main Features:</h2>

                <p><b>Hawking's</b> main features are:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Text to Speech</li>
                    <li>Customizable Voice Roles</li>
                    <li>Customizable Reading Voices</li>
                    <li>Custom Commands</li>
                    <li>Acronyms Dictionaries</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <h1 id="initialsetup">Initial Setup</h2>

                <h2 id="invitinghawkings">Inviting Hawking's</h2>

                <p>First of all, you need to <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=828540208743710741&permissions=301034496&scope=bot%20applications.commands">Invite Hawking's</a>
                to your <b>Discord Server</b>. After that, a message should be recieved in one of your server's text channels. Take a look around!</p>

                <h2 id="serversetup">Server Setup</h2>

                <p>If any message is recieved when <b>Hawking's</b> joins your server, then... dont worry! Just do the following:<br>
                <li><code>&nbsp/server_language&nbsp</code></li>
                Choose your server's default language.<br>
                This language will be used for read all the users' messages with the <b>Text to Speech</b> module. But also, this will be used for
                the bot embedded replies.<br><br>

                <li><code>&nbsp/whitelist&nbsp</code></li>
                Whitelist some channels.<br>
                The bot itself can only read those messages sent in whitelisted channels. Make sure you whitelist at least <b>one</b> channel for the bot to work.<br><br>

                <li><code>&nbsp/modules&nbsp</code></li>
                Choose the modules you want to be active.<br>
                Some people just want <b>Hawking's</b> to be a text to speech bot... And that's ok! That's the main function for which the bot was made in first place.
                Enable and disable the modules you want. It is your choice!</p>

                <h2 id="patreon">Patreon</h2>

                <p>As said before, <b>Hawking's</b> is a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Google Cloud Text to Speech</a> based Discord bot.
                But, what does it means? Well, this means <b>Google</b> charge us for using it's API Services. Why Google Cloud? Simple, even the basic voices
                are clear enough to be understood when a message is readed by the bot. But that's not all. As you can test by your own, the bot's response time
                for reading messages is really short. This is because the Google's API Services are made for that!<br><br>

                With that said, there's something you need to know. As the bot grows, the Google's API Services use increases at the speed of light! That's why i
                made a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hawkingtts?fan_landing=true">Patreon Campaign</a> for <b>Hawking's</b>. This way, the bot can be alive one more day!
                </p>

                <h2 id="topgg">Top.gg</h2>

                <p>However, <b>Hawking's</b> will be free-to-use as much as it can be, and you'll be able to use it without expending any penny.
                You can always support us by voting for us into <a href="https://top.gg/bot/828540208743710741/vote">Top.gg</a>. This way, <b>Hawking's</b>
